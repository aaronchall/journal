Why This isn't a Blog
=====================

My blog is a place to make announcements, to share with people advancements
in my projects, and share thought-proviking ideas. This journal thing isn't
that at all — it has an entirely different purpose.

What I intend here is to share small snippets of what I'm thinking, things
that are too long for Tweets, in an unordered, somewhat messy format.

I was inspired to do this while reading [Letters from a Stoic](http://amzn.to/2pL9pgM).
It is a colleciton of letters from a philosopher that others read because they find
her thoughts about life interesting and insightful.

One thing that struck me as rather odd while reading the book (I'm only a few
chapter in) is how highly the author seems to hold themselves in high regard —
as if their writing and thoughts are somhow important to the lives of others.

I do not share this perspective; I don't think what is written in this journal
is inherintly meaningful to anyone except for myself. But, perhaps someone
will find something in it interesting, and because of that, I will occassionally
share from it.

I do, however, quite enjoy the narrative that the work presents, and that is
something that I want to emulate. A somewhat public conversation with one's self,
in a candid fashion, that simply shares tidbits of the innner workings of the
author's world and mind.

It certainly can't be harmful, now can it?
