# Working from Home — a Double-Edged Sword

I've been working remotely for about six–seven years. It's a fantastic
lifestyle choice, that I highly recommend to anyone who finds working
in an office to be a struggle.

However, there are some downsides to working from home that I've been
considering lately. Namely, the lack of social interaction throughout the
workday.

When I first started working remotely, I was quite worried about this, so
I signed up immediately for a local coworking space where I could be
surrounded by peers.

Much to my surprise, about a month into it, I stopped showing up to the coworking
space entirely. I much preferred just working from my home office, instead.

I'm in a weird place now — a big part of me feels like I'd thrive in a
social workspace environment, but at the same time, I know my workflow wouldn't
work well in that environment. For example, I often take breaks from working
during the day to make music. I couldn't do that away from my home studio.

I miss working with others though, sometimes.
