# Switching Cameras (again)

It’s come to be that time again -- the time where I decide to change up my camera for no other reason other than "I’m bored". 

This seems to happen every 1–1.5 years, and while I sometimes regret the decision afterwards, it has always kept me moving forward as a photographer and as an artist. 


## The Choice: Panasonic RX850

I sold my beloved Fujifilm x100F and Ricoh GR (which mostly went unused nowadays), and decided to pick up a Panasonic RX850, in black, as well as an Olympus 17mm f/1.8 lens (which is approximately equivalent to a 35mm lens).

Very happy with the exchange/purchase so far. The camera couldn’t be tinier. 

This is my first Micro–Four–Thirds camera, and I’m very happy with the form factor so far. I’m not thrilled about the 3:4 aspect ratio of the sensor, but cropping to 2:3 is simple enough in-camera. 


## Thoughts Thus Far

- I’m very impressed with the size of the device -- it’s extremely small -- effectively the smallest usable camera with interchangeable lenses on the market. 
- I’m very impressed with the 4K video capabilities. Sound quality is sub-par, of course, but that’s to be expected. 
- Not having a viewfinder is scary.
- I’m a little worried that image quality won’t hold up for serious photo shoots.

Overall, I’m excited about the camera, and am a little scared about not having a viewfinder. I’m confident that it’ll work out for the best, though.
