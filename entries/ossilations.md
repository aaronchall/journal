# Oscillations

My mood has been oscillating quite dramatically lately, and it’s been quite unsettling. I don’t feel in control of my life, and at the mercy of various medications and stimulants. 

All seems to slowly be stabilizing, which is good.

My theory is that I just experienced what is known as a [mixed affective state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_affective_state), and I’m slowly coming out of it. It’s like hell on earth, effectively, and only seems to rear it’s head at night, once my stimulants wear off. 

I also recognize that working from home is putting it’s toll on me — being a lone all the time is hard for a person. I live at home with my wife, which is lovely. But, that’s my main social interaction, and it can be tolling.

I need to get out more.
